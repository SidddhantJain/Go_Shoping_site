# Go_Shoping_site

Developed a dynamic web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface. The backend was powered by Golang, leveraging its robust capabilities for efficient server-side logic and API development.

Key Features:

Frontend: Designed an interactive UI with clean layouts, enhanced by JavaScript for seamless interactivity.
Backend: Built RESTful APIs in Golang to handle data processing, communication, and secure user interactions.
Integration: Successfully connected the frontend with the backend, ensuring smooth data exchange and functionality.
This project showcased my ability to combine frontend aesthetics with backend efficiency, resulting in a full-stack application ready to solve practical challenges.
